# EmotionLights ðŸ˜€ðŸ’¡

EmotionLights is an open-source application that enhances your environment by dynamically changing the background lights according to your emotions. Powered by OpenAI's vision model, this innovative tool accurately detects emotions from images and adjusts the lighting accordingly. The frontend of EmotionLights is developed using Tauri, while the backend is implemented in Express.

## Features:

- Dynamic Lighting: EmotionLights analyzes your emotions using OpenAI's vision model and adjusts the background lights to create an atmosphere that matches your mood.

- Tauri Frontend: The frontend interface is built with Tauri, providing a sleek and responsive user experience across different platforms.

- Express Backend: The backend infrastructure is developed using Express, ensuring robustness and scalability for handling emotion detection requests.

- Open Source: EmotionLights is an open-source project, inviting contributions from developers worldwide to enhance its features and functionality.

## How it Works:

- Image Input: Users provide images through the application interface or an integrated camera.

- Emotion Detection: The backend utilizes OpenAI's vision model to analyze the provided images and detect the user's emotions.

- Light Adjustment: Based on the detected emotions, EmotionLights dynamically adjusts the background lights to match the user's mood.

## Upcoming Feature:

- Light Glowing: Currently under development, the light glowing feature will add an immersive layer to EmotionLights. It will enable the application to control physical LED lights, creating a synchronized glowing effect that complements the detected emotions.
